Ideas:
    - move from SVN to a more private repo 
    - continuosly analyze the current plan, abandon the plan if something goes wrong (like a blue puck in the circle)
    - move bumpers -> based on strategy
        - attack enemy pucks
        - disperse clustered friendly pucks
        - move friendly pucks in the way of the sled (when in wandering mode, or always) 

Version 0.03
    - better implementation of the wandering phase (now the target is "locked on", and no random movement appears
      (except for some really exceptional cases))

Version 0.02
    - improve wandering (make the sled go towards the "best" red puck)
    - implement bordering (border-less table)
    - limit the number of open circles started by the sled

Version 0.01
    - first version of a playable AI
