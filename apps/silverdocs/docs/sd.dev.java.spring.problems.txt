Spring resource loading problem with classpath*:/...
        - according to (http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/resources.html#resources-wildcards-in-path-other-stuff)
          when loading resources from all the places in the classpath, the loaded resources MUST be in at least one
          folder deep. This means that the resources cannot be loaded from the root of the classpath:
          Expr: classpath*:/*Props.properties                    -> NOT WORKING
          cannot be loaded, since the resources are checked in the root of the classpath. Instead, this will work:
          Expr: classpath*:/props/*Props.properties              -> OK

2 Spring web applications using Log4JListener, throw exceptions at runtime
        - the Log4JListener exposes the web application root system property, and when running two web
          applications, the system property exposed by one of the is overidden by the other one. The solution
          is to declare the log4jExposeWebAppRoot context param:
            <context-param>
                <param-name>log4jExposeWebAppRoot</param-name>
                <param-value>false</param-value>
            </context-param>
