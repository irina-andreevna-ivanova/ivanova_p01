Reading Tom DeMarco, Slack
----------------------------------------------------

Business instead of Busyness
    - Human capital
    - how much a person that leaves really cost you?
Culture of Fear
    - quote from Umberto Eco's "The name of the rose": laughter, for a few minutes, distracts the villein from fear. But law is imposed by fear, whose true name is the fear of God"
    - many organizations today promote the Culture of Fear
    - managers and bosses in general are depicted as angry mobs
    - once established, the Culture of Fear gets in the way of everything that is healthy and worthwhile
    - the paradox of overstaffind (loading a project with too many people, making the project fail or at least evolve in a bad shape or manner).
      This also imposes great stress on the manager, who now has to divide the work not only of a half dozen, but on 30-60 people, keeping them busy,
      giving them something (anything!!) to do. Not to mention the fact that the design phase must be performed with as few people as possible, until
      all the important design decisions have been made
    - ironically: in this age of "lean and mean", it is positively unsafe for you to run the project with a lean (optimal) staff
Litigation
    - nowadays, litigation is more than common between medium-to-large companies (most of the time also involving small companies, which however
      don't stand a chance, in most cases)
    - rule for litigations: nobody wins! everybody loose!
    - enormously costing
    - reasons for litigations:
        - litigation can be an effective way to deflect blame
        - litigation can be a consequence of an intrinsically flawed contract
    - sometimes litigations of first type are created just to cover problems of the second type
    - in healthy organizations, a certain amount of failure is acceptable, and not assessed with blame
        - ex Microsoft, with "sink, and swim" policy (people are loaded with a certain amount of responsability, so that they fail the first
          time, then have a chance to rest and analyze their performance, and then succeed the next times)
    - in a Culture of Fear organization, failure MUST be punished
        - in some companies all the managers are evaluated every year, and the bottom 10% are fired
        - competition and suspicion between departments
        - you have either to do good, or the other departments to do bad
    - the flawed contract could be the guilt
        - of the Buyer (incorrect specs, incomplete, out-of-the requirements)
        - of the Seller (desperate need for getting the contract, getting ahead of the competition by winning the contract at a impossible
          schedule/price)
        -
    - !!!both sides deserve to loose!!!
    - purpose of negotiation
        - NOT: screw the other side
        - OK: principle of fair exchange: you should arrive to an agreement that is equally acceptable from both sides
    - a good contract requires slack
        - you as Buyer have to see that the vendor has left enough slack on its side
Process Obsession
    - standards are a very good thing: but only product standards, not process standards
    - regulations exist for how a product should look like or function, but not how the internal parts are organized, or how it is manufactured
    - Frederick Winslow Taylor: The Principles Of Scientific Management: he called for standardization of manual factory activity so that the human
      pieces
    - star workers: analyzing the stars in a company, and the general workers, people have identified that the tasks completed by the stars were pretty
      much done in the same manner as the non-start workers, the efficiency was the same. However, the connections between the stars and the other
      workers were much more tight, more warm and more friendly.
    - ownership of the standards should be in the hands of those who do the work. It doesn't mean that you give all the control, only some of it.
    - along with this control given, you also give responsibility and possibility of error for the destination people. This however also motivates them
      so that they don't disappoint you or let you down/make you look bad.
Quality
    - best program ever: Photoshop :)
    - talking about quality while at the same time not allowing for slack is useless
    - quality improvement programs should focus on: uniqueness, usefulness, market impact, change of customer work modes, etc
      and not only on absence of bugs and deffects
    - a common way to make yourself more efficient is by shifting some of your work to your customer
Efficient and/or Effective
    - efficient: get the job done on time (even though it could not be the right thing to do)
    - effective: get the right job done
    - directing an entire organization is hard. Seeming to direct it, on the other hand, is easy. All you have to do
      is not which way the drift is moving and instruct the organization to go that way.
    - the more optimized and specialized an organism is, the more likely that the slack necessary
      to help it become more effective has been eliminated.
Management by Objectives
    - performance of each department or division is characterized by one or a few quantitative measures,
      called objectives. Managers are encouraged to manage to objectives, to do more of X, to do exactly the
      same thing as last year, but this time with more of X.
    - MBO wrongfully believes that
        - the success of the overall organization can be viewed as the simple sum of all the lower-level objectives
        - the net contribution of something so large as a corporation department can be reasonably approximated by a single indicator.
Vision
    - one of the most common signs of absence of vision is not knowing "who we are". In that direction, perhaps the first good
      step is to make a list and acknowledge what we are NOT.
    - without vision, a company can react, but cannot pro-act
    - successful change can only come in the context of knowing what CANNOT change in the organization.
      That forms the organization culture. Culture is that which CANNOT, WILL NOT and MUST NOT change.
    - the leadership is much more powerful when it happens horizontally inside a company, and not vertically, in the company's hierarchy structure
    -
Dilbert reconsidered
    - who then shall lead? -> How about you?
    - most discussions about leadership are actually monologues about followership
    - in a good company, sometimes the people follow, but are not innate followers. Leadership must be 
      everybody's business. 
    - leadership is a rotating function. Following whoever has got the hot hand is just a side effect
Fear and Safety
    - the must-have ingredient of organizational change is safety
    - in the world of corporate change, the sticks and bones are survivable, but names are killers
        - irony, sarcasm, pointed jabbing criticism, personal mockery, public humiliation, exasperation, etc - these
          are the true enemies of essential change
    - this types of disrespect must be rolled out of the organizational culture
    - every failure has to feel like a treasure
    - falure gains that person more respect
Trust and Trustworhiness
    - to gain trust:
        - (official way) you gain trust by demonstarting trustworthiness
        - (the other way, the undeserved trust) always give trust slightly in advance of demonstrated trustworthiness
        - acquire trust by giving trust
        - you have to know when to give trust, turn your back, and take your chance
        - trust is gained by giving trust, in a rational/calculated way (even though a little bit risky sometimes)
        - the leadership talen tells you when to trust, whom to trust and how much to trust
        - you need to sense how much is that person capable of doing
Time to Change
    - the best time for a change in the organization is not when things started going down on the charts, but
      when things are going up for quite a long time and, even if you don't know for sure, you are approaching
      the climax for the corporation success
    - during the corporation growup period, the people are less change-resistant. Also the inertia of success will
      boast your efforts for change. 
What middle management is there for
    - where does change happen?
        - in the middle part of the org chart
        - the key role of middle management is reinvention
    - the reinvention takes place in the time out of the time for day-to-day business
        - ergo, the need for slack
    - without the slack, the middle management people will only do their functional role, no reinvention
Where Learning Happens
    - teams are very important in the learning process, because they align the goals, they help passing the panic
      for the new things that are learned
    - teams also help team members to pull in the same direction
    - teams provide an ideal environment for learning. A place where coaching and being coached are an integral
      part of each day's work
