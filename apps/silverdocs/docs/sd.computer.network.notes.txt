Network architecture notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application Layer
    - the layer closest to the user
    - interacts with applications that contain a communication module
    - provides functions for identifying communication partners, determining resources availability, syncronizing communication
    - implementations: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc
Presentation Layer
    - provides independence from the various ways to represent the data that is sent and receieved from the network
    - converts from application to network format
    - converts the received data to a format that is easily understood by the App Layer
    - formats, encrypts data before sending it and after receiving it
    - e.g.: serialization/deserialization of objects to/from bytestream or XML
Session Layer
    - takes care of session, starting and gracefully closing the sessions
    - provides full-duplex, half-duplex, simplex operations 
    - provides checkpointing, adjournment, termination and restart procedures
    - used intensively by the remote procedure call modules of applications
Transport Layer
    - provides reliable data transfer between parties, through flow control, segmentation/dessegmentation, error control
    - TL can keep track of segments, and resend those that fail
    - there are 5 classes of TP: class 0 for networks that are really safe - class 4 for networks really unsafe
    - visualize the TL as the mail post office, where a mail is reliably sent to other parties, without the protocol to have any knowledge
      about the content of the mail
Network Layer
    - provides services for transferring variable length data from one network to another, while maintaining the QoS requested by the Transport Layer
    - performs network routing (this is the level where routers work), fragmentation, reassembly
    - reports delivery errors
    - Layer 3 protocol: IP (it is not responsible for correct delivery of packets, but only for correct discarding of errored packets)
    - IP is also responsible for fragmenting the packet into sufficiently small packets, that the medium can accept
Data Link Layer
    - used mainly for correcting the transmission errors generated from the Physical Layer
    - was also used for point-to-point and multi-point protocols, but it is not used so much for this, nowadays
Physical Layer
    - implements the physical connection layer between parties
    - takes care of handshaking, sending bits over the wire, 
    - conversions between various types of signal transmission (over the UTP cable, the optical fiber, etc) and the bytes send to the next layer
