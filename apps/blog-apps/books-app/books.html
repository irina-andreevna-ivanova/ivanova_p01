					<p>What I liked about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Werber">Bernard Weber</a>'s book (first of the 3-book-series of the Ants) is the two stories that are threaded in parallel: the one of the ants, and the one of the people related to Edmond Wells. In the end the two stories reach a common point, and that is also the point were the SciFi part of the book is the most intense (that is, the communication between ants and people). The rest of the book is SciFi only partially, I think, and that is concerning the ability of the ants to think and plan their actions in the way that they do it in the book.
					I say partially, because... who knows... perhaps they can do it! :)</p>

					<p>Reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Under-Dome-Novel-Stephen-King/dp/1439149038/ref=sr_1_1?s=gateway&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1285500736&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Stephen King’s “<em>Under the Dome</em>“</a> has been a nice experience. At first you get to know a lot of characters that are living in the unfortunate local town, and this might be a little confusing, at first. However, the author comes back to each character on a somehow regular basis, so that you don’t forget what was that character doing and how he or she relates to the other people involved in the action. Also, all these character get to bring their share of participation and changing in the course of events in a manner that I really got to enjoy.</p>
					<p>What got me by surprise in the book is the end of the story. The book has a considerable size, and the action goes in a fast pace. However, the actual explanation for the dome (the reason why the dome is there, who or what is powering it up, why that city and not a different one, perhaps why not a more important one) as well as the end of the entire story happens very fast, in less than 50 pages. You wait the entire book for getting the explanation for it, and when you actually get it you realise it is not quite the one you expected, or the one that you considered as a possible option. Sure, the alien element of the dome is presented to the user at about 1/3 of the book, but I think everyone reading the book expects the dome to have a more <em>earthly</em> nature. However I consider this as a good element of the book, as I was not disappointed by the outcome of the story.</p>
					<p>The end of the book also tends to be philosophical and get a 2nd sub-level of interpreting the events, which is something that you don’t encounter in the rest of the book. All in all, though, an excellent reading and some great times that I had with it.</p>

					<p>The main theme is a number of planets that have been conquered by a race of oppressive conquerors. There, the story starts on Earth, but Earth is not truly centrally involved, and the affairs of this group of worlds is seen as a small matter within a larger galaxy.</p>
					<p>The hero is sent to Rhodia, the strongest of the conquered planets. There he gets involved in romance and intrigue. There are rumours of a world where rebellion is secretly being plotted — but is there anything <em>to</em> it?</p>
					<p>A sub-plot involves a search for an ancient document that will help a future empire-yet-to-be (likely Trantor<a title="Trantor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor"></a>) govern the galaxy — the document is ultimately revealed to be the United States Constitution.</p>

					<p>Well… I didn’t like this book. The action might have been interesting, if I were to read this book without thinking for the whole Foundation series. But after reading like 1/3 of the book I decided that I want to skip to the next book.</p>
					<p>On the <a class="external text" title="http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/links/cool_sci_fi.html#asimov-suggested-reading-order" rel="nofollow" href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/links/cool_sci_fi.html#asimov-suggested-reading-order">page that presents the entire list of 15 books that are part of the Foundation</a>, the author of the list says explicitly that this book (#6) and the next one (#7) are not actually part of the Foundation series, so it was understandable that this book had no connection (or at least I didn’t saw a connection) to the rest of the books.</p>

					<p>Centuries have passed since Elijah Baley died, but the woman that loved him so much, Gladia, lives on (being a Solarian, she can live for 300-400 years), and her robots, Daneel and Giskard (the latter one having the capability to read human thoughts and also influence them, on a certain degree) engage in the battle against the scientist Kelden Amadiro, who tries to destroy the Earth by activating the radioactive layer of the Earth’s crust.</p>
					<p>An interesting thing here is that the conspiration of Kelden Amadiro and his assistant, Levular Mandamus, is bad only regarding the very short timespan intended for destroying the Earth. Since the blue planet is over-populated, the only chance of the human population is to leave the planet and establish on other planets. Therefore, the two robots try and succeed in stopping Kelden Amadiro from destroying the Earth too fast, but at the same time they help Mandamus to activate the radioactive layer of the Earth, but with only a very slow evolution. This will give the Earth inhabitants enough time to leave the planet and establish on other planets.</p>

					<p>The team of Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw gets another case of crime, this time on Aurora, where the “brother” of R. Daneel Olivaw, itself a humanoid robot, is killed (more exactly brought in a state of logical conflict, where the robot is no longer capable to take a decision, and its positronic circuits are burned).</p>

Another crime takes place on Solaria, a planet with geographical and atmospherical conditions similar to Earth, but a very low population of human beings (approximately 10000), a high number of robots (1000-10000 robots per person) and some very strange and interesting sociological conditions (with some simple words, phobia for meeting another human being in person or touching it).</p>
					<p>During the investigation of the crime, Elijah meets Gladia, a solarian woman that is directly involved in the crime. Falling in love with her, he helps her to escape from the planet and get to Aurora, where the sociological conditions are much better than on Solaria.</p>

					<p>After finishing the three classic books with Ender, written by Orson Scott Card, I thought that the next step should be to read the Foundation books, by Isaac Asimov. Reading on the wikipedia <a title="The Foundation series" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series" target="_blank">about this</a> left me a little bit confused regarding which books and in which order should I read, in order to get the whole content, as was intended by Isaac Asimov.</p>
					<p>Therefore, I found this reference on the same wikipedia page: <a class="external text" title="http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/links/cool_sci_fi.html#asimov-suggested-reading-order" rel="nofollow" href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/links/cool_sci_fi.html#asimov-suggested-reading-order">15-Book Reading Order as Suggested by Asimov</a>. Below are some of my comments on these 15 very interesting books.</p>
					<p>The first of the 15 books from this collection introduces the robots, their stories and the various interactions between them and the humans. Only one or two of the stories present the robots as some malevolent entities, planing against and threatening the life of the human beings. In the rest of the stories the robots are presented as some positive thinking mechanisms, geared towards the fulfillment of the human beings’ commands and directions.</p>
					<p>However, there are some stories in which the robots get to the logical conclusion that the human beings are less capable than them and eventually, because of the natural selection, the human beings will disappear and the robots will rule the Earth.</p>

						<p>Somewhere near the end of the last year I rediscovered my passion for SF books, and since I had no author in mind to start with, I searched on Google for top 100 SF books. The search directed me, among other sites, to <a href="http://home.austarnet.com.au/petersykes/topscifi/lists_books_rank1.html" target="_blank">this one</a>, which is by far one of the best collections of SF media, organized by user votes. I also found <a href="http://gurge.com/amd/top100/" target="_blank">this one</a>, but the first one got my attention being much more organized and also providing reviews and book comments.</p>
						<p>This way, after finishing Frank Herbert, <a href="http://bogdanmocanu.wordpress.com/2008/04/13/frank-herbert-dune/" target="_blank">Dune</a> I started reading “Ender’s Game” (published in 1985), by Orson Scott Card (well not really “after”, since in between them I enjoyed <a href="http://bogdanmocanu.wordpress.com/2008/06/01/philip-k-dick-time-out-of-joint/" target="_blank">Time out of joint</a> by Philip K. Dick). However, I am planning to <em>devour</em> book by book from the aforementioned top 100 SF book list.</p>
						<p><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Spoilers ahead, not suited for those that haven’t read the book.</span></p>
						<p><strong>Ender’s Game and Harry Potter</strong></p>
						<p>I haven’t read Harry Potter, by J.K. Rowling (first book published in 1997). Not because I didn’t had the time, or because I didn’t had the opportunity to get the books, but simply because I didn’t liked the way the books were written. However I did see the movies, read comments and reviews of the books, so I am aware of the plot and the characters. That’s why when reading Ender’s Game I got the strange feeling that the story is somehow related to the little-wizard books.</p>
						<p>The book is full of action, so there isn’t really much time to get bored or to analyze the situation, the characters or the decision taken for various actions. We are introduced in the current situation of the Earth, as it is on the edge of a third attack from an alien race. The army has just lost one of the great generals it had, which defeated the alien army in the second encounter. Now they are looking for a boy to be trained to become the next great general that will lead the human armies against the alien race in the third battle for protecting the blue planet. This way a handful of world’s most talented children are taken from the Earth and transported to the Battle School Space Station in order to train them for the battles with the aliens. Among these children we can find the main character of the book, the six-year old Andrew “Ender” Wiggin.</p>
						<p>This little boy proves to be extraordinary, managing to quickly advance the training levels. At the same time, more and more students start to hate him, and the troubles start to appear (as if the training session weren’t exhausting enough and the life without his parents and beloved sister hard and difficult to bare).</p>
						<p>After being promoted to the last classes of the Battle School, he meets the retired general that almost defeated the alien race during the second encounter. The general, Mazer Rackham, begins a completely different series of exercises with Ender, in which the boy gets the support of his colleagues and friends from the previous classes that he attended. A very nice first twist of the events happens in the end, when the author reveals the fact that the games that Ender was playing were actually real attacks lead by the human army against the alien race and their space ships. The second twist is plotted by the author just when you think that everything will end in a happy manner, as you discover that the aliens never meant to attack the humans, that the first attack was simply an attempt from their side to discover new civilizations, and that all they wanted was to be left alone.</p>
						<p>Therefore, the victory that everyone was fighting for proves to be a genocide, in which all the alien bugs find their end.</p>
						<p>As I said in the beginning, this book reminds me of the Harry Potter series (without considering this a bad thing). Here we have the same extraordinary boy, that fights to save the world. The fate is not very gentle with him, and several of his colleagues and teachers are against him. Moreover, we have the Battle School that trains talented children to become capable leaders in the fight against the alien bugs. He proves to be superior to all his colleagues, and in the end he succeeds in accomplish his goal and save the planet.</p>
						<p>Overall the book is a pleasure to read, without any difficult or boring moments. As the reader progresses in the book, he or she gets more and more emotionally attached to boy Ender, and there is even a moment in the book when the boy is so tired and exhausted after so many battles and games played in the training rooms, that you could almost feel his desire for a moment of peace, for a complete night of sleep, for a Sunday in the true meaning of the word.</p>

                     </div>
						<p>I finished quite a while ago reading “Time out of joint” by Philip K. Dick. I started reading this book right after finishing Frank Herbert’s Dune series (you can find a review of this series <a href="http://bogdanmocanu.wordpress.com/2008/04/13/frank-herbert-dune/" target="_blank">here</a>). The book is ok, being easily included in the category of interesting books.</p>
						<p><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Spoilers ahead, not suited for those that haven’t read the book.</span></p>
						<p><strong>The first half and the Truman show</strong></p>
						<p>The first half of the book is pretty dull as the reader is introduced in the boring and nothing-is-happening-here atmosphere of a small town. The characters are faded, with no elements to really catch the eye (or, that is, the mind of the reader). The book spices up a little bit when the main character (Ragle Gumm) starts having some weird experiences with the time freezing up. However these little weird events are in a small number (like 3 or so) and, what is most interesting, they do not count after the first quarter of the book. This is really strange, it is as if the author wanted to make something out of these events, but then changed his mind and nailed the story to a totally different direction.</p>
						<p>Next the reader in introduced in the weird and silly game that Ragle Gumm is playing (and out of which he makes a living). Up to the end of the first half of the book you get the feeling of what is actually happening, at least partially. If you have seen Peter Weir’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/" target="_blank">Truman Show</a> movie, you will surely think that the movie is some kind of remake after this book (the book appeared in 1959, and the movie in 1998). The main character starts to notice that something is wrong around him, that some people are acting strange and that some kind of plot is clearly going on behind him. Just like in the movie, he starts to suspect everyone, and begins his numerous attempts to escape the town. Of course, all his efforts are without results, as weird people from the army are struggling to keep him inside the town.</p>
						<p><strong>The nice finale</strong></p>
						<p>Raggle Gumm finally manages to escape the town and get to the outside world. He realizes that what he has suspected is true, the current date is not 1959 as people from the town believe, but 1997. However, he also finds out very soon that the real world is actually in the middle of a war with the people that built an establishment on the Moon, that periodically these people are launching atomic rockets towards the Earth and that the game he was playing was actually used by the army to discover where the next atomic rocket will hit the earth.</p>
						<p>While living in the 1959-town without knowing what was actually happening, he was able to guess each day the correct solution of the game in the newspaper. The newspaper was presenting the readers with a board of 1208 cells, and the readers were asked to guess where a little green man will appear in the next day. Raggle Gumm was able to guess each day the exact position of the little green man. The solutions that he was sending to the newspaper were used by the army to launch the anti-missile projectiles that were keeping the Earth safe from the atomic offensive.</p>
						<p>The book’s ending could have been better, since it is really not clear why the lunatics (the people that escaped the Earth and established on the Moon) are those that stand for the correct concepts and why Raggle Gumm runns away from the Earth, and to the Moon. You can only guess or, better said, assume that this will help ending the war and resolve the crisis between the lunatics and the Earth-inhabitants. Nevertheless the book was ok, and it was clearly something totally different than the political-philosophical atmosphere of Dune.</p>
